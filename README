Learn Ruby The Hard Way exercises

http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/

YMMV:
I didn't think about uploading this to github until around exercise 21.
Before 21 I wasn't thinking much about file naming, specifically with regard to the extra credit changes, or commenting.

Ruby Version:
When I started this I noticed some of the exercises weren't behaving as expected.
I was using an older ruby version.
I started using ruby 1.9.2-p290 and everything started behaving according to the exercises.
